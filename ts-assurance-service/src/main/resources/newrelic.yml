  # ============================== LICENSE KEY ===============================

  # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic
  # account. For example, if your license key is 12345 use this:
  # license_key: '12345'
  # The NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY environment variable is also checked.
  # This key binds your Agent's data to your account in the New Relic service.
  license_key: <%= System.getenv("NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY") %>

  # Agent Enabled
  # Use this setting to disable the agent instead of removing it from the startup command.
  # Default is true.
  agent_enabled: true

  # Set the name of your application as you'd like it show up in New Relic.
  # If enable_auto_app_naming is false, the agent reports all data to this application.
  # Otherwise, the agent reports only background tasks (transactions for non-web applications) to this application.
  # To report data to more than one application
  # (useful for rollup reporting), separate the application names with ";".
  # For example, to report data to "My Application" and "My Application 2" use this:
  # app_name: My Application;My Application 2
  # This setting is required. Up to 3 different application names can be specified.
  # The first application name must be unique.
  app_name: ts-assurance-service

  # Set to true to enable support for auto app naming.
  # The name of each web app is detected automatically
  # and the agent reports data separately for each one.
  # This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for
  # web apps in New Relic.
  # Default is false.
  enable_auto_app_naming: false

  # Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming.
  # Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction.
  # Default is true.
  enable_auto_transaction_naming: true

  # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging
  # separate from that of your application. Specify the log level here.
  # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application.
  # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are:
  #   off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest
  # Default is info.
  log_level: info

  # Log all data sent to and from New Relic in plain text.
  # This feature is very useful for debugging, but can increase disk space usage significantly.
  # Default is false.
  audit_mode: false

  # The number of backup log files to save.
  # Default is 1.
  log_file_count: 1

  # The maximum number of kbytes to write to any one log file.
  # The log_file_count must be set greater than 1.
  # Default is 0 (no limit).
  log_limit_in_kbytes: 0

  # Override other log rolling configuration and roll the logs daily.
  # Default is false.
  log_daily: false

  # The name of the log file.
  # Default is newrelic_agent.log.
  log_file_name: newrelic_agent.log

  # The log file directory.
  # Default is the logs directory in the newrelic.jar parent directory.
  log_file_path: /tmp

  # The agent communicates with New Relic via https by
  # default. If you want to communicate with newrelic via http,
  # then turn off SSL by setting this value to false.
  # This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your
  # application code, so response times will not be directly affected
  # by this change.
  # Default is true.
  ssl: true

  # Proxy settings for connecting to the New Relic server:
  # If a proxy is used, the host setting is required. Other settings
  # are optional. Default port is 8080. The username and password
  # settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges
  # from a proxy server.
  #proxy_host: hostname
  #proxy_port: 8080
  #proxy_user: username
  #proxy_password: password

  # Limits the number of lines to capture for each stack trace.
  # Default is 30
  max_stack_trace_lines: 30

  # Provides the ability to configure the attributes sent to New Relic.
